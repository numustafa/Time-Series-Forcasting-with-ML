TS forecasting using ML techniques with Python. This is a learning project and I got inspired by the work of [RobMulla](https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/time-series-forecasting-with-machine-learning-yt/notebook). 

The ML algorithm of XGBoost is used to tackle this tabluar data. The data is available on Kaggle and all files can be accessed there.
